### Description:

Your handy e-pub lib&amp;reader for your browser!



_It is currently in development, but you can try the test-version without the backend trough emulating it with **http-server** and **json-server** **(make sure to install them before proceeding or run using npx)**. To start the preview run "./test-run.sh" from your projects folder. It is pretty raw but soon enough you'll be able to see the full version._

### Current tasks:

0. Finish the API;

1. Add 'Upload/Delete' buttons for lib;

2. ~~Add React Router support~~;

3. ~~Add 'Prev/Next' buttons~~;

4. Add bookmarking;

5. Translator feature (_highlighting?_);

6. 'Edit' button for lib;

7. Merge with backend repo.
