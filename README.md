# lnreader

### !Update!

The project started as an idea of making a web based substitute for the epub reader that I once have had on my laptop - Foliate, ofc, with some quirks that are easy to implement having it as a WebApp. After I setted up Gentoo as my main system I couldn't compile Foliate and I honestly don't like any other alternatives as even for now. And at the moment I'm more inclined towards embedded development(don't tell it to my pm pls) and consider my previous toolset as _bloated_, cause imho making _everything_ web based is a bad idea. Though the project was fun and I'll continue its development, but considering the issue that I've made to many things on a front end side of the things I'll do a rework now with more of a back end stuff. Have a nice day!

_It is currently in development, but you can try the test-version without the backend trough emulating it with **http-server** and **json-server** **(make sure to install them before proceeding or run using npx)**. To start the preview run "./test-run.sh" from your projects folder. ~~It is pretty raw but soon enough you'll be able to see the full version.~~_

0. ~~Finish the API~~;

1. ~~Add 'Upload/Delete' buttons for lib~~;

2. ~~Add React Router support~~;

3. ~~Add 'Prev/Next' buttons~~;

4. Add bookmarking;
